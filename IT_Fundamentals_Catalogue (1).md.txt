### 4. Security Protocols Comparison
| Protocol | Purpose | Encryption | Strengths | Weaknesses | Use Case |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| WEP | Basic wireless security | Weak | Easy to set up | Outdated, vulnerable | Avoid |
| WPA | Improved over WEP | TKIP | Stronger than WEP | Still not ideal | Deprecated |
| WPA2-AES | Modern encryption | AES | Strong, current standard | Not always default on old devices | Recommended |
| WPA3 | Latest standard | AES + better handshake | Strongest | Device compatibility | Future-proof |
