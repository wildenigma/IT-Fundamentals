🌐 Networking Fundamentals

This section breaks down essential networking concepts in simple terms, practical troubleshooting, and real-world resolutions.

📘 Definitions

IP Address: A unique number assigned to every device on a network.

DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names (like google.com) to IP addresses.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.

Router: Directs data packets between networks.

Switch: Connects devices within a local network (LAN).

Firewall: Protects networks by blocking unauthorized access.

MAC Address: Physical address of a network interface card (NIC).

💡 Explanation (Layman's Terms)

Imagine your network is a mail system:

IP = mailing address

DNS = address book

Router = mail carrier between cities

Switch = mail sorter within the post office

MAC = apartment number

Firewall = security guard

🛠️ Common Networking Issues & Fixes

Problem

Possible Causes

Resolution Steps

No Internet Access

Bad cable, router offline, IP conflict

Restart router, check cables, renew IP

DNS Server Not Responding

Misconfigured DNS settings

Use Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4

IP Conflict

Two devices share same IP

Release/Renew IP, set static IP

Intermittent Connection

Weak signal, interference, outdated driver

Update Wi-Fi driver, move closer to router

Slow Speed

Bandwidth overload, router limit

Reboot router, limit connected devices

🧪 Practice Q&A

Q1: What command checks your IP settings in Windows?

ipconfig

Q2: What command tests the connection to another host?

ping [destination]

Q3: What’s a quick fix for "DNS not resolving"?

Change to Google DNS in adapter settings.

Q4: What’s the difference between switch and router?

Switch connects devices locally, router connects networks.
