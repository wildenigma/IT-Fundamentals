## üéì Overview

CompTIA A+ is often the first step into IT careers. These labs simulate real-world help desk, hardware, and OS issues you'll likely face on the job.

## üîß Lab 1: No Display Output (Hardware)

**Scenario**: A user reports that their desktop turns on, but nothing shows on the monitor.

**Steps to Practice**:
1. Power off and unplug the machine.
2. Open the case and reseat RAM and GPU.
3. Plug in the monitor to onboard graphics if available.
4. Try another known-working monitor and cable.

**Expected Outcome**: Determine if GPU is faulty or if another component (e.g., RAM or PSU) is causing boot failure.

## üåê Lab 2: No Internet Access (Network Troubleshooting)

**Scenario**: A user can't connect to the internet but the computer shows it's connected to Wi-Fi.

**Steps to Practice**:
1. Use `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` to confirm IP address.
2. Ping `8.8.8.8` to check for external reach.
3. Run `nslookup google.com` to verify DNS resolution.
4. Reboot router or reassign a static IP if needed.

**Expected Outcome**: Restore working internet and document findings.

## ü™ü Lab 3: Windows Blue Screen

**Scenario**: Random BSOD with error `MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`.

**Steps to Practice**:
1. Boot into Safe Mode.
2. Run `sfc /scannow` and `chkdsk`.
3. Use Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
4. Update all drivers or roll back recent updates.

**Expected Outcome**: Identify and resolve hardware/driver-related crash.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab 4: Printer Not Responding

**Scenario**: A shared network printer isn't responding for multiple users.

**Steps to Practice**:
1. Verify power/network connections.
2. Restart print spooler (`services.msc`).
3. Check IP address of printer and test ping.
4. Re-add printer via control panel.

**Expected Outcome**: Restore print services and document steps taken.
