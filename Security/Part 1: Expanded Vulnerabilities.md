# Common Security Vulnerabilities

This document describes critical security vulnerabilities found in IT environments, including traditional systems, applications, and cloud platforms.

---

## 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Description:**  
Attackers inject malicious SQL commands into input fields, compromising databases.

**Impact:** Data breach, system compromise.

**Mitigation:** Parameterized queries, input validation.

---

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into trusted websites.

**Impact:** Credential theft, session hijacking.

**Mitigation:** Output encoding, Content Security Policy.

---

## 3. Buffer Overflow

**Description:** Writing data beyond allocated buffer memory.

**Impact:** Application crash, code execution.

**Mitigation:** Safe coding practices, boundary checks.

---

## 4. Weak Passwords & Credential Stuffing

**Description:** Simple or reused passwords exploited via brute force.

**Impact:** Account compromise.

**Mitigation:** Strong passwords, multi-factor authentication.

---

## 5. Misconfigured Security Settings

**Description:** Improper firewall rules, open ports, public cloud buckets.

**Impact:** Data exposure, unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:** Regular audits, principle of least privilege.

---

## 6. Insecure Deserialization

**Description:** Unsafe handling of serialized objects allows code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution.

**Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data.

---

## 7. Broken Authentication & Session Management

**Description:** Flaws in login/session handling.

**Impact:** Account takeover.

**Mitigation:** Secure authentication libraries, session timeout.

---

## 8. Security Misconfiguration

**Description:** Default credentials, unpatched software, verbose error messages.

**Impact:** Data leaks, system compromise.

**Mitigation:** Harden configurations, patching.

---

## 9. Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:** Inadequate encryption or data masking.

**Impact:** Data breaches, regulatory issues.

**Mitigation:** Encryption at rest/in transit, masking.

---

## 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Description:** Lack of event logging and alerting.

**Impact:** Undetected attacks.

**Mitigation:** Centralized logging, regular reviews.

---

## 11. Cloud-Specific Vulnerabilities

### a. Insecure APIs

**Description:** Poorly secured APIs can expose cloud services to unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Data theft, service disruption.

**Mitigation:** Use authentication, rate limiting, input validation.

### b. Excessive Cloud Permissions

**Description:** Over-privileged cloud identities increase risk of data leakage or resource misuse.

**Impact:** Data breaches, resource hijacking.

**Mitigation:** Apply least privilege policies, review IAM roles regularly.

### c. Data Leakage via Public Storage

**Description:** Misconfigured cloud storage buckets or blobs set to public access.

**Impact:** Sensitive data exposure.

**Mitigation:** Regular audits, automated cloud security tools.

---

## 12. Application-Specific Vulnerabilities

### a. Broken Access Control

**Description:** Improper enforcement of user permissions allows unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Data theft, privilege escalation.

**Mitigation:** Enforce role-based access control, test access restrictions.

### b. Security Misconfiguration in Web Servers

**Description:** Default configurations or outdated components expose attack surfaces.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data leakage.

**Mitigation:** Regular patching, disable unnecessary services.

# Summary

Vulnerabilities can exist across all layersâ€”network, application, cloud, and user. A defense-in-depth approach, combining secure coding, strong configurations, user awareness, and monitoring, is essential for effective security.
