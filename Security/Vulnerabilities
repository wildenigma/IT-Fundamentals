# Common Security Vulnerabilities

This document describes some of the most critical security vulnerabilities encountered in IT systems, their impact, and basic mitigation strategies.

## 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Description:**  
SQL Injection occurs when attackers insert malicious SQL queries into input fields, which are then executed by the database. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or deletion.

**Example:**  
An attacker enters `' OR '1'='1` into a login form input, bypassing authentication.

**Impact:**  
- Data breach or loss  
- Full database compromise  
- System takeover

**Mitigation:**  
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements  
- Validate and sanitize user inputs  
- Employ web application firewalls (WAF)

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:**  
XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Types:**  
- Stored XSS (persisted on server)  
- Reflected XSS (in URL or input)  
- DOM-based XSS (client-side only)

**Impact:**  
- User account compromise  
- Credential theft  
- Session hijacking

**Mitigation:**  
- Encode and sanitize all user inputs and outputs  
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers  
- Implement secure frameworks that auto-escape outputs

## 3. Buffer Overflow

**Description:**  
Occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory. This can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:**  
- Application crashes (Denial of Service)  
- Remote code execution  
- Privilege escalation

**Mitigation:**  
- Use safe programming languages or libraries that handle memory securely  
- Perform boundary checks on buffers  
- Apply security patches regularly

## 4. Weak Passwords and Credential Stuffing

**Description:**  
Use of simple, common, or reused passwords makes it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access using brute-force or stolen credential lists.

**Impact:**  
- Account compromise  
- Data theft  
- Unauthorized access to systems

**Mitigation:**
