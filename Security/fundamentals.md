## 🔺 The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of modern information security and stands for:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized parties can access sensitive data.
- **Integrity**: Guaranteeing the accuracy and trustworthiness of data.
- **Availability**: Making data and systems accessible when needed.

### 📌 Example (Modern Use Case)
A healthcare web portal must:
- Encrypt patient records (**Confidentiality**)
- Prevent tampering with medical history (**Integrity**)
- Remain accessible 24/7 for emergencies (**Availability**)

## 🛠️ ITSM Ticket Workflow (ITIL v4-Based)

This workflow outlines how user issues are managed in a helpdesk/service desk environment:

1. **User Reports Issue**  
2. **Service Desk Logs Ticket**  
3. **Categorization & Prioritization**  
4. **Assigned to Appropriate Support Team**  
5. **Diagnosis & Resolution Actions Taken**  
6. **User Confirms Issue is Resolved**  
7. **Ticket is Closed**  
8. **Post-Incident Review (PIR) or Audit if Required**

## 🌐 Network Data Flow: Request to Resolution

Describes how a user's request travels across IT infrastructure:

### 🔄 Components in Flow:
- **User Device** (input request)
- **Router** (routes packet to network)
- **Firewall** (security layer filters traffic)
- **Switch** (routes internally to right host)
- **Server** (responds with data or service)
