# üåê TCP/IP & OSI Model Diagrams

This section explains how network data travels, using simplified OSI and TCP/IP models, device roles, and common troubleshooting scenarios.

## üß© Definitions

- **OSI Model**: A conceptual 7-layer framework that shows how data moves through a network.
- **TCP/IP Model**: A streamlined 4- or 5-layer version used in real-world internet communications.
- **Protocol**: A rule set for communication (e.g., TCP, HTTP, DNS).
- **Packet**: A chunk of data sent across a network.
- **Port**: Logical channel used to identify traffic types (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP).

## üí° Explanation (Layman‚Äôs Terms)

Think of the **OSI model** like sending a birthday package:

1. **Application**: You decide what gift to send.
2. **Presentation**: You wrap it nicely.
3. **Session**: You set up the delivery.
4. **Transport**: Choose FedEx vs. UPS (TCP vs. UDP).
5. **Network**: Route it from city to city.
6. **Data Link**: Move between houses or buildings.
7. **Physical**: Driveway to doorstep (cables, signals).

The **TCP/IP model** simplifies this into:

| TCP/IP Layer       | Corresponds To OSI Layer(s)       | Example |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Application        | Layers 7, 6, 5                    | HTTP, DNS, FTP |
| Transport          | Layer 4                          | TCP, UDP |
| Internet           | Layer 3                          | IP |
| Network Access     | Layers 2, 1                      | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |

## üîÅ Real-World Mapping Table

| Device              | OSI Layer | Description                     |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Router              | Layer 3   | Directs traffic using IP        |
| Switch              | Layer 2   | Sends data to MAC addresses     |
| Firewall            | Layer 3/4 | Filters traffic by port/IP      |
| Ethernet Cable      | Layer 1   | Physical transmission            |
| Network Interface   | Layer 1/2 | Connects a device to a network  |
| DNS Server          | Layer 7   | Resolves names to IPs           |

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

| Symptom                       | Likely Layer       | Fix                                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| No Internet                  | Layer 1 (Physical) | Check cable, Wi-Fi switch, NIC           |
| IP conflict or no IP         | Layer 3 (Network)  | Renew IP, check DHCP server              |
| App won't connect            | Layer 7 (App)      | Restart app, verify configs              |
| Dropped packets              | Layer 4 (Transport)| Check firewall, switch, port settings    |
| Website won't load by name  | Layer 7 (DNS)      | Check DNS settings, try `nslookup`       |
